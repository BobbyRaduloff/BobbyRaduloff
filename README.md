## Open Source Portfolio

Here, you can find a sample of some of the open-source work I've done.

### [js_rtc](https://github.com/BobbyRaduloff/js_rtc): JavaScript RayTracing engine that renders to a canvas in NextJS

Initially started to answer a final year project research question, the following code realistically renders metalic and diffuse spheres in plain JavaScript, a task which sounds insane but is actually quite doable. It was done in an attempt to measure how far modern browsers have come in terms of performance and to dispell some of the myths regarding client-side javascript.

Here's a render from it:

### [lowlevelboris](https://github.com/BobbyRaduloff/lowlevelboris): NextJS Blog with Static Content Generation

My personal blog, written in NextJS. It has the ability to read my blog posts in Markdown and convert them to pages on the website with the appropriate styling at deploy-time, making it extremly fast.

Here's the PageSpeed Insights:
